RecipeRecommendationApplication 

Recipe Recommendation System is an application designed to provide users with personalized recipe suggestions based on their preferences, dietary restrictions, available ingredients, and past interactions with the system. The goal of this system is to assist users in finding and preparing meals that align with their tastes and requirements.

Components of Recipe Recommendation System:
- Users: Users can specify their dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free), allergies, and flavor preferences. Baed on this, they will receive custom recipes
- Recipe Database: The system maintains a database of recipes, each with detailed information, such as ingredients, preparation steps, nutritional information, and user ratings. This database can be indexed and searched efficiently, often with technologies like Elasticsearch
- Recommendation Algorithm: Users can input the ingredients they have on hand, and the system can recommend recipes that can be prepared with those ingredients. This is particularly useful for reducing food waste and making the most of available resources
- Search Functionality: Users can search for recipes by various criteria, such as cuisine type, cooking time, dietary restrictions, and more.

In summary, the Recipe Recommendation System aims to simplify the process of meal planning and cooking by providing users with personalized recipe suggestions and helping them make the most of the ingredients they have.
